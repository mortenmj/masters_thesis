\section{Future work}

% TODO: Discuss future work

At the end of this thesis, there is a functioning object detection system in place.
Furthermore, a robust behavior tree control system, as well as the tools required to debug the system, is also available.
It is the view of the author that the next logical steps is to combine these, and use the information obtained from the object detection system to enable life-like behavior for the Cyborg.

The object detection implementations using OpenCV are fully functioning, but would benefit from CUDA support in OpenCV.
This would also be a useful avenue of research, as any contributions to OpenCV would benefit not only the Cyborg project but the larger computer vision research community.
